# SimpleShare

Welcome to the SimpleShare project! This project provides a secure and efficient way to share files directly between peers using WebRTC. The key features of this project include multi-connection support for faster transfers, end-to-end encryption, and no file storage on any server during the transfer process. For large files, the project splits them into manageable parts to ensure smooth transfer.

## Features

- **WebRTC-Based Peer-to-Peer File Sharing**: Utilizes WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer connections, ensuring low latency and high-speed file transfers.
- **Multiple Connections**: Establishes multiple connections to accelerate the file transfer process.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensures that files are encrypted during transfer, providing high security and privacy.
- **No Server Storage**: Files are never stored on any server during the transfer, enhancing security and privacy.
- **File Splitting**: Automatically splits large files into smaller parts to facilitate easier and more reliable transfers.
- **WebSocket Server**: A server facilitates the initial connection between peers using WebSockets.
